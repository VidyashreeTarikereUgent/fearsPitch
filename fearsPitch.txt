Data storage in solid data vaults.
Vidyashree Tarikere, Ruben Taelman


For a long time now, the companies with centralized user data are in charge of both the data and the development of software applications. 


Only if the data is separated from the software applications, meaning making data independent of application, will open ways for innovative and creative software applications. The problem here is to manage data when they are decentralized. 


That is, where to store this huge amount of data which is generated every millisecond and how to manage this data synchronously. 


The answer to these questions is Sir Tim Berner-Leeâ€™s Solid Project. In this project, every person will have one or more data vaults, called solid pods, where they can store and manage their own data. 


I have developed a software application, To-Do Solid application, where data and application are independent of each other. 


In this application, I have inspected different ways one can store data in their data vaults, aka solid pods. 


In this application, I have inspected different ways one can store data in their data vaults, aka solid pods.


If a person A wants to store data, example a todo, in their data vaults it can be stored in various ways.


The method I considered implementing is to put these data in different files and folders chosen by the user.


This method allows user to organise data in their data vaults in a structured way.


As a researcher, it is always useful to determine what is the optimal way of storing data, especially in a decentralized environment, such that it will provide maximum results when reading and searching these data. 


Future work will investigate the ways in which a user can store data following certain timestamp, logical relevance, geographic location and priority-wise.
